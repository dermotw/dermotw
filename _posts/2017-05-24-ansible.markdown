I've a large number of servers to manage (not *Facebook-* or *Google-*large but still: up to a hundred), both physical and virtual. Up to now I've been doing this by hand - manually logging in to servers to add software, users and so on. Nightmarishly tedious and I find myself procrastinating something awful.

No more though: I've been looking at various orchestration/dev-ops/whatyoumacallit systems recently and discovered that Ansible only requires software to be installed on the controller machine. That's right: none of the servers that need to be managed require any software to be installed, other than Python - which is generally installed anyway. Happy days.
